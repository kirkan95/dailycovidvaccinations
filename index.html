        The sheikdom has vaccinated nearly three-fourths of its population, making it one of the most-vaccinated nations in the world, as of late March 2021. According to Fouad al-Rahal, a specialist in emergency medicine at Bareen International Hospital in Dubai, the government’s attempts to “(educate) the public and (underline) the importance of following health and safety protocols” are the reason for its success. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The UAE was one of the first countries to roll out a vaccination plan, and to secure deals with vaccine makers once they passed clinical trials. Strict lockdown procedures and enforcement of public health protocols and social distancing also led to the rise in vaccination rate. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Though the UAE population is only about 3% and its GDP is only 1.97% of the United States’, its vaccination rate is double the U.S.’

        Like other countries, the United Kingdom is prioritizing citizens who are at high risk for COVID-19. Though the UK is behind countries with the top vaccination rates, it is ahead of most others. 
      </p>
      <p>
        71% of citizens in the UK expressed a clear willingness to take a COVID-19 vaccine, compared to 51% of Americans, according to a Michigan State University’s Quello Center study. 
      </p>
      <p>
        “The data suggests that due to the confusion that existed in American politics, with even our leaders at the highest levels casting doubt on the pandemic, the scientific message was muddled in the U.S., whereas in the U.K. there was a unifying voice,” center director Johannes Bauer said. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The UK population is only 20.32% of the U.S. population and its GDP is 13.07% of the U.S. GDP. However, it boasts a vaccination rate 1.18 times that of the U.S.

        Although neighboring countries have vaccinated lower than 10% of their populations, Chile has emerged as a global leader in vaccination rate, with 44% of its population vaccinated. The South American country has consistently been prosperous and stable, especially compared its neighbors. 
      </p>
      <p>
        When it comes to vaccines, it shook on deals with vaccine distributors quickly, bringing the country to the forefront of the world’s vaccination effort. Its public health safety measures were stricter than other South American countries like Brazil—though COVID-19 still took a toll on its population, and the fight against the disease wasn’t without its challenges. 
      </p>
      <p>
        While Chile has 5.76% of the U.S.’ population and 1.32% of its GDP, its vaccination rate is 1.22 times the U.S.’
